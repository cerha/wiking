= Installation instructions for Wiking CMS =

Dependencies:

  * apache >= 2.0 (prefork MPM!)
  * mod_python >= 3.2.10
  * postgresql >= 8.0 (8.1 suggested)
  * python >= 2.3 (2.4 suggested)
  * lcg >= 0.3.4
  * pytis >= 0.1.0
  * pyPgSQL
  * mxDateTime

Multithreaded Apache MPM is currently not supported.  Since it is the default
in many distributions, please check and switch to prefork MPM to be able to run
Wiking.

When you have all the above installed, run "make install" in the package root
directory.  You need to have GNU make to be able to run the automatic
installation.  You may also wish to change some variables at the beginning of
the Makefile to customize the installation.

After installing Wiking, you must configure Apache to use Wiking for serving
your site.  Please, see the included HTML documentation.  Installation
instructions are 'in doc/html/admin.html'.  If you are installing from CVS, you
will need to run "make doc" to generate the HTML documentation (or read the
text source).
