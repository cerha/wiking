Multithreaded Apache MPM is currently not supported.  Since it is the default
in some distributions, please check and switch to prefork MPM to be able to run
Wiking.

When you have all the above installed, run "make install" in the package root
directory.  You need to have GNU make to be able to run the automatic
installation.  You may also wish to change some variables at the beginning of
the Makefile to customize the installation.

After installing Wiking, you must configure Apache to use Wiking for serving
your site.  Please, see the Administration section within the included HTML
documentation.  If you are installing from CVS, you will need to run "make
doc" to generate the HTML documentation (or read the text source).
