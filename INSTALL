= Installation instructions for Wiking CMS =

Dependencies:

  * python >= 2.3 (2.4 suggested)
  * apache >= 2.0 (prefork MPM!)
  * mod_python >= 3.2.10
  * lcg >= 0.5.1
  * pytis >= 1.1.1 (please check it's own dependencies)
  * python-dnspython - DNS client module for Python
  * python-egenix-mxdatetime - Python date/time manipulation routines
  * python-imaging - Python Imaging Library (needed only when using Image galeries)  

Multithreaded Apache MPM is currently not supported.  Since it is the default
in some distributions, please check and switch to prefork MPM to be able to run
Wiking.

The simplest installation can be done using the provided Makefile.  Just run
"make && make install" within the package root directory.  Feel free to
edit the Makefile and setup your own installation paths.

You can also run the development version directly out of your checked out tree,
being able to check out a newer version at any time and using this new version
right away.  The Makefile supports this setup by linking the necessary
directories into your checked out tree.  You need to run "make && make
install-links" for the first time, and then just "make all" after each
checkout.

After installing Wiking, you must configure Apache to use Wiking for serving
your site.  Please, see the Administration section within the included HTML
documentation.  If you are installing from CVS, you will need to run "make
doc" to generate the HTML documentation (or read the text source).
