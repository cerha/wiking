Version 0.4.4 (not released yet)

 * The usage of extension modules and their relation with menu items and pages
   was completely reworked.  Extension modules can now be embedded into page
   text and thus there is no more the need to distinguish between pages and menu
   items.  Each menu item is now a page and all the properties are managed from
   within one place.

 * Multiple simultaneous logins to one account made possible.

 * Email notifications after user registration and account approval.

 * Major improvements in users and access rights management.

 * Password reminder.
	
 * Bug fixes


Version 0.4.3 (2007-09-17)
	
 * Content management controls outside the management interface (greatly
   simplifies most common tasks by directly including controls within the
   content for authorized users).

 * Unified and simplified management of main menu and content hierarchy.

 * Owner can be assigned to grant privileges for individual pages.

 * Wiking API separated from the CMS and documented.  This API allows
   development of web applications based on the Wiking platform.

 * Support for browsing long lists.

 * Many minor improvements within the user interface.

 * Bugfixes


Version 0.4.2 (2007-04-10)

 * Built-in authentication.

 * User registration and management.

 * Assignment of user roles and privileges.

 * Page attachments (external files, such as images, documents etc. may be used
   within page content...).

 * Documentation extended.


Version 0.4.1 (2006-11-13)

 * This is the first functional version of the new generation of Wiking CMS.
   New Wiking is written in Python, and is based on Pytis toolkit and LCG.  The
   old Perl version will be maintained, but no new functionality will be added.
