   file).

 * Added support for ARIA landmarks.

 * Improved user registration, account confirmation process and user management.
 
 * Added bulk mailing support to allow sending email to all registered users or
   to certain user roles (new tab "Services" in WMI).
 
 * Panels are now also displayed in WMI in the same form as outside WMI.

 * WMI link was moved to the login panel (if enabled).
  
 * Registration notification emails are now sent in HTML to prevent confirmation
   URI misinterpretation.

 * RSS links are now automatically displayed within panels and announced in page
   header meta tags.

   well as dynamically based on the server name in the current request URI.

Version 0.4.4 (2008-10-01):

 * New page can be now created an published in one step.  The insertion form now
   includes both, the language dependent texts and language independent options.

 * Page order number is now generated automatically on page creation to append
   the page to the end of the current menu hierarchy level.  The menu visibility
   in now controlled separately by a "Hidden" checkbox (as opposed to the
   previous practice of not entering the order number to denote a hidden page).

 * The "parent" field for selection of the page position in menu hierarchy now
   displays the items sorted and indented according to their hierarchy.

 * Attachments can be moved between pages (button "Move", select the target page
   and confirm).

 * The usage of extension modules and their relation with menu items and pages
   was completely reworked.  Extension modules can now be embedded into page
   text and also management of their contents (i.e. adding/editing/removing
   messages of a News module) is now done directly within the corresponding
   page.  This reduces the "Content" section of WMI to a simple listing of all
   pages, since everything is now managed through them.

 * Email notifications are sent automatically after user registration and
   account approval and password reminder is now possible 

 * Multiple simultaneous logins to one account are now possible.

 * Major improvements in users and access rights management.

 * Secure authentication through user certificates is now supported.
  
 * Management of panels was moved from "Content" section to "Setup" in Wiking
   Management Interface.

 * Active color theme selection is now done directly in section "Look &
   Feel/Color themes" in WMI, not in Configuration (using the "Activate" button
   on one of the available themes.

 * There may be two configuration files applied for each site.  The global
   configuration is read first (i.e. /etc/wiking/config.py) and site specific
   configuration file may be set through apache configuration, overriding the
   global configuration values.

 * The default option value is displayed in help texts for all options in the
   "Setup/Configuration" section of WMI.  Thus you exactly know which value will
   be used when the option is left blank.

 * New configuration options added.

 * Experimental support for improved accessibility using the ARIA standard and
   JavaScript driven keyboard navigation and automatic focus.  The keyboard
   navigation allows quick access to page contents hierarchy (menus, panels,
   language selection...).  Focus is automatically moved to the main contents of
   the page or form fields when appropriate (i.e. in login dialog).

 * More specific labels for user actions, such as "New attachment" instead of
   generic "New Record" are more intuitive and improve the usability.

 * Action buttons are now represented using real buttons in HTML, not links.
   This improves navigation for assistive technology users, since they can move
   directly to actions from anywhere within the form.


Version 0.4.3 (2007-09-17)
	
 * Content management controls outside the management interface (greatly
   simplifies most common tasks by directly including controls within the
   content for authorized users).

 * Unified and simplified management of main menu and content hierarchy.

 * Owner can be assigned to grant privileges for individual pages.

 * Wiking API separated from the CMS and documented.  This API allows
   development of web applications based on the Wiking platform.
