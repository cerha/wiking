	 * Content management controls outside the management
	   interface (greatly simplifies most common tasks by directly
	   including controls within the content for authorized users).
	 * Unified and simplified management of main menu and content
	   hierarchy.
	 * Owner can be assigned to grant privileges for individual pages.
	 * Wiking API separated from the CMS and documented.  This API

	   platform.

	 * Many minor improvements within the user interface.
	 * Bugfixes

	Version 0.4.1

	This is the first functional version of the new generation of
	Wiking CMS.  New Wiking is written in Python, and is based on
	Pytis toolkit and LCG.  The old Perl version will be maintained,
	but no new functionality will be added.
