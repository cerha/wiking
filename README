Wiking is a Python web application development platform.  Wiking is distributed
together with Wiking CMS -- an extensible content management system built on
top of this platform.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

HTML documentation is included.  If you obtained Wiking from source control,
you will need to run "make doc" to generate it into HTML.  You can also view it
online at the project homepage.
