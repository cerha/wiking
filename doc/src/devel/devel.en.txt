= Wiking Developer's Documentation =

Wiking is a platform for web application development.  The content management
system described in [cms] is just an example of an application built on top
of this platform.  This section describes Wiking from developer's point of
view.

The extensibility of Wiking is based on modularization.  The core functionality
is implemented by the Wiking Handler.  This handler handles all requests and
uses modules to perform different stages of request processing, such as
authentication, uri resolution etc.

Thus it is possible to customize the bahavior by overriding the core modules.
The core modules form the so called 'Wiking API' which is described in the
section below.

Wiking also provides a set of predefined modules, which implement various
common usecases for the core modules, such as a cookie based authentication
module, session management, static uri mapping, serving formatted documents
from structured text files etc.

Documentation for these modules is not yet part of this document, so please see
the source code and the relevant Python docstrings.
