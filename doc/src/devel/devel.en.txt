= Wiking Developer's Documentation =

Wiking is a platform for web application development.  The content management
system described in [cms] is just an example of an application built on top
of this platform.  This section describes Wiking from developer's point of
view.

== Technology ==

Wiking is written in Python and is based on two other important components:

 * *Pytis* ... provides data abstraction, modularization and database access.

 * *LCG* ... provides content abstraction, internationalization support and
   html generation (see [http://www.freebsoft.org/lcg|LCG project website] for
   more information).

Wiking can be also considered a web interface to the Pytis toolkit.

The current implementation runs on Apache web server (over mod_python) and
stores its data in the PostgreSQL database.  Thanks to a high level of
abstraction, these components could be replaced, however.
