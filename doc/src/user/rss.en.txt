== Web Feeds (RSS) ==

The technology of web feeds allows Internet users to subscribe to certain
resource (called RSS feed or RSS channel) to get a quick overview of provided
news, articles or other items.  See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS
Wikipedia] for more info about RSS.

Some browsers have built-in RSS support.  With other browsers you will need to
install an RSS reader as an external application or use a web service such as
[http://my.yahoo.com My Yahoo!], [http://reader.google.com/ Google Reader] or
[http://www.bloglines.com/ Bloglines].

Wiking makes it possible to read items from different sections of a website
using the RSS protocol.  You will find an RSS link at the bottom of each
section which supports it.  Use the address of this link to setup your RSS
reader.
