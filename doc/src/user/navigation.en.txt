== Navigation Menus == menus

A Wiking site may have two levels of navigation:
  * Main menu
  * Local menu of the current section

The main menu contains top level sections and is displayed as a row of folders
at the top of the page by default (the appearance may vary significantly when
the site uses custom styles).

The local menu displays a hierarchical list of all subsections of the current
top level section.  It is by default displayed on the left side of the page as
a separate column labeled "In this section:".  When there are no sub-ordinary
sections within the current top level section, the local menu will not be
displayed at all.

The current menu item is visually emphasized so that the user always knows
where he is at the moment.  If this visual information is not accessible for
you, you may still find out where you are using the [#breadcrumb-navigation].

Users of assistive technologies may want to skip the menus, since they are
repeated at the top of each page.  See the section [#moving-around] for more
information.

== Breadcrumb navigation == breadcrumb-navigation

The so called "breadcrumb path" displays your current position within the site
contents hierarchy as a set of links.  The path starts with the current top
level section and ends by the current page, allowing you to jump directly to any
higher level in the hierarchy.  It can be found at the top of the page and it
is labeled "You are here".

See the related [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation) Wikipedia
article] for more information about breadcrumb navigation techniques.

The breadcrumbs in Wiking are primarily used as an aid for users of assistive
technologies and are not displayed in visual browsers by default.


== Moving around the current page == moving-around

Apart from the actual content, web pages often contain fixed parts which repeat
on each page throughout a website.  The typical repetitive parts of a Wiking
page are:

  * [#breadcrumb-navigation]
  * [#languages]
  * [#menus]
  * [#panels]

A visually oriented user may ignore those parts, since they are visually
distinguished from the main content.  They may, however, impose a problem for
AT users.  Wiking tries to help by a "screen reader friendly" implementation of
these parts and by providing additional navigation mechanisms.  These may or
may not be suitable depending on the assistive technology being used.

Screen reader driven navigation
   Users of modern screen readers may skip the repetitive parts simply -- menus
   and all panels are labeled by level 3 headings and precede the main content.
   The main content starts with a top level heading.  So you can get to the
   main content by one key-press or jump around menus and panels by repeating a
   third level heading jump.

Page navigation links
   You will find a set of links labeled "Jump in page" at the very top of the
   page.  The first of them will always get you to the main content, the
   following will move your focus to the menus, panels and language selection.
   These links are most convenient for text oriented browsers.

Keyboard shortcuts
   Some of the [#shortcuts] also allow you to jump within the page.


== Shortcut Keys == shortcuts

There are several shortcut keys (access-keys) simplifying navigation:

  * *1* ... go to the home page
  * *2* ... skip repetitive parts (go the the actual page content)
  * *3* ... skip to the main menu
  * *9* ... enter/leave the Wiking Management Interface
  * *0* ... show the Accessibility Statement

Usage in different types of browsers:

  * Internet Explorer -- Alt + number Enter
  * Firefox 1.x, Mozilla, Netscape 7+  -- Alt + number
  * Konqueror -- press and release Ctrl, number
  * Opera -- Shift + Esc + number
  * Safari, Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape, Omniweb (on Mac OS X) -- Ctrl +
    number

Shortcut keys should not be considered the primary means of navigation.  Their
usage varies from browser to browser and some browsers don't support them at
all.  In addition, the key bindings are not standardized, so the behavior
differs from site to site.

Many assistive technologies implement their own page navigation features.  If
these features substitute the above commands, they should be always preferred.
For example the page content begins with a top level heading, thus it may be
possible to get to it using the heading navigation feature of the AT.


== Tables of Contents ==

Tables of Contents show the hierarchy of the current page content.  As opposed
to [#menus], they don't refer to other pages, but just to subsections of the
current page.

They display a set of links allowing you to jump to a selected section
directly.  Each section header also acts as a link back to the Table of
Contents.  This feature may significantly simplify page navigation in longer
texts.  Give it a try right on this page...

Some pages may use multiple Tables of Contents in different levels of
hierarchy.  In this case, the back-reference links from section headers lead
always to the nearest TOC up in the hierarchy.


== Language Selection == languages

Wiking supports serving content in multiple languages.

Selection of the most appropriate language for each user is performed
automatically based on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation
Content Negotiation] technique.  This technique relies on the language
preference settings of your browser.  An English speaking user, for example,
should have English set as his/her primary language, plus any number of
additional languages which he/she understands with their respective precedence.

A selection algorithm is performed on each request.  If given page is available
in one of the preferred languages, the highest precedence variant is returned to
the user.  When none of the requested languages can be served, an error page
406 (Not Acceptable) is returned and the user can select one of the available
language variants manually.

Besides the automatic selection described below, user can also select the
language explicitly from the language selection menu.  This menu is displayed
in the top right corner of the page (in the default style) when there are
several language variants of the current page.  When there is just one variant,
the language selection menu is not shown.  The menu appears right after the
main navigation menu in a text browser.  Since the set of available language
variants may be different for each page, the language selection menu may differ
as well.  Current language (as well as current menu item) is emphasized
visually and marked by an asterisk in a text browser.

If "cookies" are enabled, the manually selected language will be kept as the
preferred language for further requests with even higher priority than the
browser settings.  This feature allows you to override browser settings when you
can't modify them, such as in an Internet cafe or at a public terminal.
Correct browser settings should still be the preferred solution, however.


== Panels == panels

Panels are brief information windows, which are displayed by the right hand
side in the default style.  They usually summarize the most important
information from given website.  Panels appear unchanged on each page of the
site.  For example a News panel may display the most recent news with links to
more detailed messages within the News section.

Panels can be hidden, using the "Hide panels" link (located above them).  This
setting is sticky (panels stay hidden for the following requests) when
"cookies" are enabled in the browser.  Panels can be unhidden again using the
"Show panels" link.  Of course, when a page doesn't use any panels, these links
don't appear on the page.

Users of assistive technologies may want to skip panels, since they are
repeated on each page.  See the section [#moving-around] for more information.
