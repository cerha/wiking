== Accessibility Statement ==

This site is built using the [http://www.freebsoft.org/wiking Wiking] web
application development framework.  One of the major aims of this system is
providing equal access to all users, including people with handicaps and/or
special needs.  Wiking also tries to be neutral to user's software, hardware
and settings.  Thus the resulting pages should be usable with any browser, font
type or size, screen resolution, assistive technologies etc.

The system was developed considering formal accessibility standards, such as
[http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0] or
[https://www.section508.gov Section 508] as well as real end user experience.
Accessibility and usability was tested with different combinations of assistive
technologies, especially screeen readers.

You will find information about navigation and accessibility related features
in the chapter [navigation Navigation] of the User's Manual.
