== Accessibility Statement ==

This system was developed with the goal to provide equal access to all users,
including people with handicaps and/or special needs.  Neutrality to user's
software, hardware and settings was also carefully pursued.  Thus the result
should be well usable with all common types of devices, screen sizes, operating
systems, browsers, font types and sizes, assistive technologies etc.

The development considered formal accessibility standards, such as
[http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0] or
[https://www.section508.gov Section 508] as well as real end user experience.
Accessibility and usability was tested with different combinations of assistive
technologies, especially screeen readers.

You will find information about navigation and accessibility related features
in the chapter [navigation Navigation] of the User's Manual.
