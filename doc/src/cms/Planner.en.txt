= Planner =

This module allows you to publish a callendar of planned events.  Each event
has a date when it takes place.  Optionally you can also define en end date --
this is useful when an event takes more than one day.  Events are sorted by
date -- the nearest at the top.  Expired events are automatically omitted, so
the list only contains future events.

You can attach a bief text to each event.  This text can be formatted as an
``LCG structured text'' document (see the
[/_doc/lcg/data-formats/structured-text formatting manual]).

Planner events for each language variant of the website are managed
independently.  Only events for the /currently selected language/ are
displayed, so you need to switch the language to be able to manage news for a
different language.
