= Introduction =

The Wiking Content Management System allows you to run a website which is
highly accessible and fully controlled directly from a web browser.

Key features: @TOC@

  
== Accessibility ==

The Wiking CMS provides a high level of accessibility for the visitors as well
as for content creators.

An important design goal was the maximal support for available
[http://www.w3.org W3C] standards.  See also the [accessibility] for more
information.

The concept of content creation using the "structured text" format proved to be
well usable for people without technical background.  Moreover, together with
an accessible user interface, this makes Wiking a suitable content management
tool for blind people or people with other handicaps.

== Customizable look & feel ==

An attractive look can be easilly achieved using the predefined styles and
color themes without disturbing the accessibility.

  * The content is stored in a presentation neutral format.
  * Independent styles define the final layout and presentation.
  * Predefined styles allow easy customization without technical knowledge.
  * Custom styles may be created with CSS knowledge.
  * Color themes can be simply modified.
  * Reusable styles and color themes can be shared with other Wiking users.

== Localization ==

Wiking user interface is currently translated into the following languages:
  * Czech (complete)
  * English (complete)
  * German (mostly complete)
  * Polish (incomplete)
  * Slovak (mostly complete)
  * Spanish (incomplete)

Adding support for other languages is in progress.  Thanks to the GNU gettext
framework it is relatively simple.  

== Support for Multilingual Content ==

The system was designed to serve multilingual content from the very beginning.
You can manage multiple language variants of your content and Wiking defines
the logic needed for serving it.

Most important features:
  * The most appropriate language variant is selected automatically based on
    „Content Negotiation“.
  * User can choose the language explicitly from the list of available language
    variants.
  * The language of the user interface is automatically translated to the
    language of the current content.

See [navigation#languages] for more information.

== Technology ==

Wiking CMS is written in Python as an application built on the top the Wiking
web application development platform (see [devel] for more information).  The
modular design of this platform allows additional functionality to be easilly
implemented and integrated within the system.

== Licence ==

The Wiking CMS is Free Software licensed under GPL.

== Getting started ==

After installation and basic setup described in [admin], you should be ready to
run Wiking CMS right away.  Just point your browser to the corresponding URL.
When you come to your site for the first time, the database will need be
initialized.  Wiking will detect that and guide you through the database
initialization process.
