= Panels =

``Panels'' are small boxes which are usually displayed sidewise.
Unlike other content, panels appear on every page of the website beside its
main content.  The main content changes while browsing different sections
of the site, but the panels remain where they are.

There may be arbitrary textual content on each panel, but probably the most
practical feature of panels is that they can display items of some other
module.  For example the module [News] will display recent news on the panel.
You can also define how many items are displayed.

There may be a different set of panels for each language variant of the
website.  Only panels for the /currently selected language/ are displayed, so
you need to switch the language to be able to manage panels for a different
language.

The order of panels on the page is determined by the ``Order'' number.
