= Extension Modules =

Extension modules provide a simple means for embedding "smart" content within a
page.  Wiking comes with several built in modules, but additional modules can
be installed independently for each site.

The built in modules are:

  * [#news] -- list/manage short messages (supports RSS).
  * [#planner] -- calendar-like listing and management of planned events
    (supports RSS).
  * [#users] -- list/manage registered users

== News == news

The News module is designed for short messages.  Each message has a
brief summary, a time-stamp and a more descriptive text.  The basic view is
handled by displaying a list of recent messages (newer messages at the
top).

The message text can be formatted as an ``LCG structured text'' document
(see the [/_doc/lcg/structured-text formatting manual]).

News items for each language variant of the website are managed independently.
Only messages for the /currently selected language/ are displayed, so you need
to switch the language to be able to manage news for a different language.

== Planner == planner

This module allows you to publish a calendar of planned events.  Each event
has a date when it takes place.  Optionally you can also define en end date --
this is useful when an event takes more than one day.  Events are sorted by
date -- the nearest at the top.  Expired events are automatically omitted, so
the list only contains future events.

You can attach a brief text to each event.  This text can be formatted as an
``LCG structured text'' document (see the
[/_doc/lcg/structured-text formatting manual]).

Planner events for each language variant of the website are managed
independently.  Only events for the /currently selected language/ are
displayed, so you need to switch the language to be able to manage news for a
different language.

== Users == users

This module allows you to embed the list of registered users into any page.
This is mostly practical to allow the users to view each others profile,
contact infomation etc.

Standard page options may be used to make the list completely public or private
(only available to logged in users).
