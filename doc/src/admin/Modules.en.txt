= Modules =

Here you manage the modules recognized by your wiking site.  You
can add new modules, remove unused modules and enable/disable the existing
ones.  This is a system module and it doesn't handle content.

Before adding a new module, this module first needs to be installed by the
system administrator.  Adding it into the list only makes the module
available from within the management interface.  Removing (or disabling)
hides the module from the management interface.
