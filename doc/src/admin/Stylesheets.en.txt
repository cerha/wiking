= Stylesheets =

This module allows you to manage stylesheets used for your Wiking site.
Stylesheets, together with [Themes Color Themes] allow you to customize the
appearance of your Wiking site.

It is possible to edit the stylesheets directly, however this is only
encouraged if you know CSS and Wiking stylesheet handling details.  The primary
intended use of this module for most website administrators is management of
predefined Wiking stylesheets.  There are several stylesheets preinstalled with
the system.  Other may be created and shared by the Wiking user community.

Management is quite simple -- you can activate or deactivate any stylesheet.
You will immediately see the results.  You can add your own stylesheets and
override certain settings of other stylesheets.

There are two special cases -- 'default.css' and 'panels.css'.  You should not
edit the contents of these stylesheets.  Their contents is not in the database
-- it is supplied by the system to allow their automatic upgrade when Wiking is
upgraded.
