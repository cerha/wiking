= Pages =

You can create and manage pages with generic text content and possibly graphics
in this module.  The content itself can be directly edited as an ``LCG
structured text'' document.  The format is described in the
[/_doc/lcg/data-formats/structured-text formatting manual].

There can be multiple language variants of each page, but only records
corresponding to the /currently selected language/ are displayed in the table.
You need to switch the language to be able to manage pages of other languages.

Use the /Mapping/ module to add pages to the main menu, change an existing
identifier or publish/unpublish each item.

The table shows ``state'' of each page.  This can be one of the following three
values:

   * /Missing/ ... page is not defined in the current language.

   * /Changed/ ... page content was modified, but the changes were not yet
     published, so visitors still get the previous content.

   * /Ok/ ... the page exists and is up to date.

A ``missing'', page can be created either directly by editing it, or it may be
more convenient to use the ``translate'' action, which lets you choose the
source language.  The content is then prefilled and you create the page text by
overwriting the original text by its translation.
