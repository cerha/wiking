= Languages =

This module allows you to manage the set of available languages.  You can add
any language as it's lowercase ISO 639-1 Alpha-2 language code.

The configured languages become automatically available for content creation.

See the chapter [navigation#languages Language selection] of Wiking Users Guide
for more information how multiple language variants are served to website
visitors.


= Language selection in WMI =

The Wiking Management Interface allows you to switch to any of the configured
languages at any time (as oposed to the normal website view, where only
languages, for which the content actually exists, are available).

When you view a content listing of a particular module in WMI, only items
corresponding to the current language are shown, if the items are language
dependent.  For language independent content, all items are shown, regardless
the current language.
