= Languages =

This module allows you to manage the set of languages supported by
your site.  You can add any language as it's lowercase ISO 639-1 Alpha-2
language code.

The configured languages become automatically available for creating new
content.  This is a system module and it doesn't itself handle any content.

= Language selection in WMI =

The Wiking Management Interface allows you to switch to any of the
configured languages at any time.  The important think to know is, that
when you view a content listing of a particular module in WMI, only the
items corresponding to the current language are shown, if the items are
language dependent.  For language independent content, all items are shown,
of course.

= Serving the content in multiple languages =

For the website visitors, the content is always selected according to their
language preferences (browser setting).  When the content is available in
one of the accepted languages, the best-matching variant is served.  If
not, Error 406 (Not Acceptable) is returned and the user is allowed to
select manually from the available language variants.
