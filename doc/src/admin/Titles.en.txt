= Titles =

This module assigns titles to particular mapping items (identifiers).
These titles then, among others, appear in the main menu.

The titles are normally assigned automatically when you create new pages,
but you will need to assign the title here for the items which are either
not regular pages (are handled by some other module), or which don't have a
corresponding page in all supported language variants.

When there is a title missing for an item, you will realize that easilly.
There will be just the identifier displayed in the main menu, instead of
the title.  This may be sufficient at some cases, but you will often want
to supply better titles.  This can be done by adding a new title assignment
to this table.  Please remember, that you should specify titles for all
supported languages.  This way the main menu will be fully translated in
all available language variants.  When there is no content for some item in
given language, the user will be automatically redirected to a different
language version of the document according to his language preferences.

Only titles for the /currently selected language/ are displayed, so you
need to switch the language to be able to manage titles for a different
language.
