= News =

The News module is designed for short messages.  Each message has a
brief summary, a time-stamp and a more descriptive text.  The basic view is
handled by displaying a list of recent messages (newer messages at the
top).

The message text can be formatted as an ``LCG structured text'' document.
See the [/__doc__/lcg/data-formats/structured-text formatting manual].

The news items for each language variant of the website are managed
independently.  Only messages for the /currently selected language/ are
displayed, so you need to switch the language to be able to manage news for
a different language.
