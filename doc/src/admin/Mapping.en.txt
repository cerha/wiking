= Mapping =

This module maps the available URIs to particular Wiking modules which handle
them.  The /Identifier/ is the name of the resource as seen from outside.  The
item "=mypage=", for example, will have the address (URI)
\http://www.yourdomain.com/mypage/.

Each identifier maps to a single /Module/, which is responsible to handle all
requests to this URI.

See the documentation of particular modules to learn more how they handle
requests and how to manage the content.


== Main menu management ==

Main menu is one of the most important navigation elements of the page (see
[navigation] for more details).

The menu can be managed simply by assigning a number in the field /Menu order/,
to each item you want to appear in the main menu.  The items will appear in the
navigation bar according to given order.  

The items which have no number assigned will not appear in the menu, but they
can be still refered to using their identifier.  You will probably want to link
to those items from other pages to make them visible to website users.


== Published/Unpublished items ==

Mapping items, as well as many other content elements, can be
published/unpublished.  An unpublished item exists in the database, so the
author can work on it, but it is not publicly visible to the website users.
