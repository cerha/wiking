= Mapping =

This module maps the available URIs to particular Wiking modules which
handle them.  The /Identifier/ is the name of the resource as seen from
outside.  The corresponding URI may be for example
\http://www.yourdomain.com/identifier/.  Each identifier maps to a single
/Module/, which is responsible to handle all requests to this URI.

See the documentation of particular modules to learn more how they handle
requests and how to manage the content.

== Main menu management ==

You can also manage the main navigation of the site here.  In the field
/Menu order/, you simply assign a number to each item you want to appear in
the main menu.  The items will appear in the navigation bar according to
given order.  The items which have no number assigned will not appear in
the menu, but they can be still referenced using their identifier.  You
will probably want to link to those items from other pages to make them
visible to website users.

== Published/Unpublished items ==

Mapping items, as well as many other content elements, can be
published/unpublished.  An unpublished item exists in the database, so the
author can work on it, but it is not publicly visible to the website users.

Publishing a Mapping item makes the URI available on the server, however
you also need to publish some content for this URI.  This must be done in
the corresponding module.  On the other hand, by unpublishing an item here,
all content becomes unavailable, even though this content may be published.
This way you can for example unpublish all language variants of one page at
one place.
