= Content =

This module handles generic content pages.  Each item in the table
assigns the actual content to one /Mapping/ item (identifier).

The content itself can be directly edited as an ``LCG structured text''
document.  See the [/__doc__/lcg/data-formats/structured-text formatting
manual].

Multiple language variants of each page are managed by this module, but
only records corresponding to the /currently selected language/ are
displayed, so you always see one page corresponding to one /Mapping/ item
(identifier).  You need to switch the language to be able to manage pages
of other languages.

To /add a new page/, you first need to create a new /Mapping/ item, which
makes a new identifier available.  Then you can create a new page which
assigns a content to this identifier in one particular language.

To /create a new language variant/ of an existing page, first select the
existing language variant and then select ``Translate'' in the actions
menu.  You can also Create a new record assigning the new language variant
to given identifier, but the advantage of the ``Translate'' action is that
you get the original text pre-filled and you can translate by overwriting
this text directly.

As described in [/wmi/Mapping Mapping], the content can be
published/unpublished.
