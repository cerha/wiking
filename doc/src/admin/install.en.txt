Dependencies:

  * python >= 2.3 (2.4 suggested)
  * apache >= 2.0 (prefork MPM!)
  * mod_python >= 3.2.10
  * postgresql >= (8.1 or later)
  * lcg >= 0.3.5

  * python-psycopg2 - Python DBAPI 2 implementation for PostgreSQL
  * python-imaging - Python Imaging Library (needed only when using Image galeries)  

Multithreaded Apache MPM is currently not supported.  Since it is the default
in many distributions, please check and switch to prefork MPM to be able to run
Wiking.

When you have all the above installed, run "make install" in the package root
directory.  You need to have GNU make to be able to run the automatic
installation.  You may also wish to change some variables at the beginning of
the Makefile to customize the installation.
