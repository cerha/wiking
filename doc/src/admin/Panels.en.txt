= Panels =

``Panels'' are small boxes which are usually displayed sidewise.
Unlike other content, panels appear on every page of the website beside its
main content.  The main content changes while browsing different sections
of the site, but the panels remain where they are.

There may be arbitrary textual content on each panel, but probably the most
practical feature of panels is that they can display recent items of a
particular section of the website.  You just select a Mapping item in the
field ``Overview'' and recent items of the corresponding module will be
displayed.  For example you select the item which is assigned to a News
module and recent news will be displayed on the panel.  You can also select
how many items are displayed.

There may be a different set of panels for each language variant of the
website.  Only panels for the /currently selected language/ are displayed,
so you need to switch the language to be able to manage panels for a
different language.

The order of panels on the page is determined by the ``Order'' number.
This order is also respected by the above table.
