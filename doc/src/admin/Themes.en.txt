= Color Themes =

Color themes allow the simplest way of appearance customisation.  The final
appearance is determined by two things -- the active stylesheet (or a set of
stylesheets) and the color theme.  The idea is simple -- the stylesheets should
only use symbolic color names and these color names are always substituted by
real colors of the current stylesheet.

This module manages the set of available color themes.  Several themes are
included in default Wiking installation.  Other themes may be created by the
Wiking user commutnity and shared.  You can also create your own themes.

/IMPORTANT/: You must go to your site configuration to activate one of the
themes defined in this module.
